<h1>Brutal Honesty: Dating - FAQs</h1>
<p>
The purpose of this document is to present myself without filter, so
people may without pressure and at their own comfort
and leisure, evaluate whether we're compatible spirits. What follows
are a collections of anonymized frequently asked questions I've
received and answers which probably describe myself better than any
dating profile I've created. Some answers have been modified and are
more complete here than as originally posted. If you're wondering, I
am perfectly normal, which is exactly why I have a public, oversharing
webpage on dating
(sorry <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_5">Seneca</a>,
I've, "part[ed] company with our <a href='https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Moral_letters_to_Lucilius/Letter_5#cite_ref-1'>promise</a>", what have I done).</p>

<h2>On Dating</h2>

<p>Some people love dating. Some people treat dating very seriously,
like a job. Some people want to find a partner as quickly as possible
or weed out candidates. Some people wear their best clothes, change
who they are, and participate in "performative dance" to impress their
suitors. Some people treat dating like interviews. Some people go to
special places on dates that they wouldn't normally go.
</p>

<p>
I've traditionally felt
incredibly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10104636754688300">reluctant
to date</a>; the formal, performative process of dating is one I truly
lament. It's so much nicer to casually meet people as friends without
pretense or preconceived expectation. I hate what society portrays
dating as. And how people behave in response to this perception.</p>

<p>I just want to live my normal life and be my abnormal self. I just
want to find someone else who is living their own life and is their
own abnormal self. I just want to find a friend who shares similar
goals and values, feels comfortable with me, and I with them, and
eventually blossom love with them if it's meant to be. I don't want to
go on dates, say that I'm on a date. I don't want anyone to engage in
a formal process where people dress up strangely or feel nervous. I
just want to create a low-pressure opportunity for possible friends to join in common interest, to venture into streams of life;
for it to be natural and for us to be on the same wave-length.
</p>

<p>I think many dislike job interviews for similar reasons. These
processes may be optimized for outcomes, but they feel optimized for
the wrong outcomes and
self-defeating. <a href="https://twitter.com/galenmancino">Galen</a>
recently recommended,
"<a href="https://openlibrary.org/books/OL25448615M/Reinventing_Organizations">Reinventing
Organizations</a>" (sorry, side-rant) and it describes two types of
orgs which emerged to solve different problems. An "Orange" class of
org which is quite capitalistic and targets and motivates performance
towards specific OKRs (not always the right ones) and "Green" orgs,
which prioritize sustainability and mission. I see parallels here in
relationships and the idea of treating relationship-building as an
outcome feels to me as an "Observer Problem" where the act of
participating undermines or conspires against the metric. Don't get me
wrong, I appreciate Brian Christian's,
"<a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL17357767W/Algorithms_to_Live_By?edition=ia%3Aalgorithmstolive00chri">Algorithms
to Live By</a>". I think there's a lot of wisdom in evaluating how
much time we're spending doing things. But I also see a risk in
prematurely automating away the "real work" of getting to know
people. I think we get what we measure. Which is why my daily
spreadsheet is intentionally a manual process (which requires -- and
whose purpose is to motivate -- introspection). The way I've started
to think about relationships is, forget dating, just meet lots of
interesting people who I'm be satisfied being friends with. This also
encourages a selection bias. The number one thing I select for if I
chat with someone on a dating app has become, "are they going to think
about this or treat this as a date". If it seems like they won't, even
though this is quite antithetical to some objective like finding a
partner, whatever, great, that's what feels most comfortable and
there's nothing wrong with being true to oneself. Unless the strategy
fails to meet one's needs, and then I encourage myself to evolve and
learn over time.
</p>

<h2>Why Date? On Tribe &amp; Chosen Family</h2>
<p>My nature is one of dedication to others and I believe in the
compounding power of investing in people. I've spent much of my adult
life living in intentional community houses with people who felt like
family. With time, often time these families evolve and drift. It
would be nice to eventually find a more permanent tribe/family that I
can invest in for a long term. Context switching is expensive and
having friends move away doesn't feel amazing. I really like teaching,
being on people's teams, listening, building, performing acts of
kindness and service, showing people appreciation and affection. I
believe that helping the people around me really will make my life
better; not just because it makes me feel better, but because it truly
is a way of creating non-zero-sum value. Humans have the opportunity
to be the real perpetual energy machine. One reason I'm trying to date
is because of weary of my family moving on and I want to find someone
who I can invest into and grow with.

<h2><a name="sports">On Sports</a></h2>
<p>
My happy place for exercise is rock climbing / bouldering. I prefer
bouldering over rope climbing because I get to control when I start an
end a route (when I feel inspired). I can stop exactly when I feel
tired. It's easier to sit and socialize with other people. I don't
enjoy the stress of, gear required, or downtime involved in belaying
for people. I prefer climbing inside to outside, because (a) outside
requires more gear, (b) may require much higher time-commitment, (c)
feels harder on the hands (my tendons are already messed up from 8+
years of climbing). I also enjoy long walks or hikes where my
attention can either focus or relax, but in either case not be ravaged
by aggressive car traffic :P. I enjoy racuqet sports (tennis, ping
pong, badminton) and kayaking. I am a runner and a dancer only when
someone I love needs to me to be.
</p>

<h2><a name="watching-sports">On Watching Sports</a></h2>
<p>I don't presently especially like watching sports. My childhood consisted of playing lots of sports, from stints of swimming, baseball, and basketball (even though I was comically short), backyard football, ping pong, and most prominently twenty years of tennis. I'd go with my mother's parents to UPenn college football games. I'd go to watch Pilot Pen tennis tournaments in connecticut, ocassionally my father would get tickets through work to go to a Yankees or Red Sox baseball game with me, or a Hartford Whalers or Boston Bruins game (even though I was a NY Rangers hockey fan -- I once met Brian Leetch's mom at my local super market in Cheshire and she randomly gave me a photo with his signed autograph because I was wearing a Mark Messier jersey). Recently, I'll go with my cousin Denis to a SF Giants game since he loves baseball. I do enjoy watching people climb at the gym, but I am more a fan-boy of semi-pros that I can still climb + socialize with (like Anson Whitmer and Austin Lee) than international all-stars. Partially, I just like participating in sports, partially I have other things I prefer doing than watching sports, and partially Noam Chomsky convinced me to ruin sports for myself with <a href="https://archive.org/details/understandingpow00chom_0/page/98/mode/2up">this essay</a>.
</p>

<h2>On Winter &amp the Cold</h2>
<p>For the reasons above in <a href="#sports">On Sports</a>, I'm
nervous about the winter and staying active because I have a hard time
being "out" going; I'm not a huge fan of the activation energy and
copious amounts of gear required to do anything (and then still be
cold). Hypothetically, I enjoy snow shoeing and cross country skiing,
but not enough to buy gear.
</p>

<h2>On Pragmatic Minimalism</h2>
<p>
I am
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functionalism_(architecture)">functional</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimalism">minimalist</a>
and have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10102163653852200">few</a>

<h2><a name="public-private">On Being Public &amp; Private</a></h2>
<quote>"It's funny how much of you is still private. Do you find it easy to share private things (depression, sexuality, kinks) with people irl<a name="irl">[*]</a>?"</quote>


<p>I think it's only funny how much of me is private if I were to
insist (based on hubris, pretense, or consistency principle -- because
so much of me is public) that there is ntohing I value keeping
private. My leaning towards being public in ways which may help myself
and others is not something I experience as inconsistent from wanting
to also protect myself and others from certain information asymmetry
or at the expense of opportunities to grow mutual trust.
</p>

<p>I am happy for my openness to be
challenged/interrogated/questioned. I invite all questions, and
appreciate being able to answer openly and honestly; I also feel no
obligation on principle to share.
</p>

<p>I find <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10103552582797460">depression fairly easy to talk about</a>. There are times it's
appropriate to be more selective and conservative with what one
shared, not of fear of being vulnerable, but rather because some
situations call for someone who can demonstrate a strong
constitution. Life is a balancing act and in order to best server
those around us who we care about, it requires being in touch with
one's feelings, being vulnerable, and sensitive, as it also demands
one be demonstratably reliable, capable, and
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200303052141/https://www.lettersfromastoic.net/letter-5-2/">relatable</a>.</p>

<h2>On Board Games &amp; Improv</h2>
<p><a href="irl">[*]</a> To
me, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10104651002854860">everything
is IRL</a>. I think this is one reason I tend to like board games less
than others; I don't like contriving simulated situations to lie or
collude, to treat people differently, or be a version of myself that
doesn't feel right. If I do roleplay, I prefer doing so by leaving the
body and writing. I do love improv, however, creating moments of
spontaneous joy and exploring parts of myself in the company of those
who I believe care and understand me enough to welcome and protect
this of me. I don't particularly like costumes (including wearing
clothing which advertises things I don't believe in, the exception
being the ocassional
sentimental <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10103116907898450">gift</a>,
which I usually kindly decline)

</p>

<h2>On Monogamy v. Polyamory</h2>
<p>I'm comfortable with people who are polyamorous and support their
life choices. I kind of get it, it's complicated but I see how it can
work. It's not for me. I don't want my partner to have any doubt about
my love for them. I want them to know fully that they come first to me
and that no one else is even in the picture of consideration. And if
or when I
have <a href="https://twitter.com/mekarpeles/status/1354338956855267331">children</a>,
I would want them to know the same thing, that unconditionally and
without question, all my resources, all of my love will go first
towards their upbringing and the world they unchoosingly inherit.
</p>

<h2>On Marriage, Having Kids &amp; Adoption</h2>
<p>As Aaron Swartz once said, "[I take the attitude that] everything
you've learned is just provisional, that it's always open to
recantation, refutation, or questioning". If I met the right person, I
may be willing to compromise on what our relationship looks like.  For
many years (until I was 25 or so) I was unenamored by the idea of
having children. When I was a child, I felt burned and angsty about
the idea of being forced on this earth without having been
consulted. But as I've gotten older and experienced things painful and
wrong about the world, I believe in my values, my affinity to care,
and ability to nurture and raise children with love, respect,
knowledge, dignity, passion, and compassion -- qualities which I'd
hope they'd share with the world. While it's pretentious and reeks of
hubris that I could accomplish all this, if I have complaints about
the world being unkind and unfair, trying to upbringing compassionate,
educated children is a small way I can fight for a more equitable
future. I think the feeling and quality of being related by blood and
genetics is special and significant and is a connection I'd really
value with my children. But if I met the right person, they wanted to
adopt, and that's what we decided, I would love my children equally
and unconditionally without doubt or question.
</p>

<h2>On Weddings</h2>
<p>
I didn't go to prom and don't regret it. I had a bar mitzvah and
predominantly regret it. I think the idea of having an expensive
wedding is kind of silly. I love the excuse of getting family and
friends together and celebrating love with them creatively. I concede
that Weddings are as much for others as it is for ourselves and if we
love others I shouldn't so quickly or carelessly rob them of their
joys. But, I don't really like being celebrated. Just as I don't like
dating, I don't like formal celebrations whose impetus is more
tradition than volition. I'd rather invest funds in a
house/family/education than an expensive traditional wedding. But the
bottom line is, I want my partner to be happy and so I'll participate
with enthusiasm if that's what's important to them.
</p>

<h2>On Religion</h2>
<p>I am a fairly areligious, agnostic, atheist cultural Jew. The
closest thing to practicing religion is doing passover or chanukah
with family as an excuse to get together. I do recognize (and did so
very late) that Jews don't exactly get to choose whether the world
sees them as Jews or not. If you're born Jewish, the world identifies
you as a Jew and I've personally experienced antisemitism
(e.g. getting beaten up for no reason other than being Jewish). As a
result, if I have children, as a matter of cultural education and
self-preservation, I'd want them to have basic education of their
cultural heritage. Not to the exclusion of anything my partner wishes
to teach them. Ultimately I feel people should being given the means
to obtain a range of context and perspectives and then choose their
own path. I think if would be a problem if I ended up with someone
very religiously Jewish (or very religiously anything). I don't want
to feel obligated for religion to be a big part of my life, other than
the ways culturally I am either empathetic towards or obligated. For
instance, I like the broad notion of shabbat (i.e. family and friends
eating together on Friday nights). And I appreciate that Judaism
encourages people to question and pursue education. I think the
history of the Jews is interesting insofar as I think all history is
important and interesting, but I am not interested in scripture.</p>

<h2>On Being Outgoing</h2>
<p>I'm very outgoing for those around me. This whole document is a
testament to my dedication to trying hard for others. I like to cook
and clean for others and be there for them when they need me. By
nature, I am however, not naturally outgoing from the perspective of
"going out". I don't love planning dates, going to fancy restaurants,
driving for hours, visiting people in other towns. I'm happy to do all
these things for people I care about, especially when I have someone
to go with, but it takes a lot of energy. There are many things in
life I have strong opinions about and want to be involved in decision
making (e.g. moral imperatives) but often times I am very satisfied
being in the company of someone I love and letting them propose the
activities, foods, tripe that they're excited about. And I'm very
happy to share the work.
</p>

<h2>On Hobbies</h2>
<p>In my free time, I like language learning. I'm
currently <a href="https://mek.fyi/curations/resources-for-learning-chinese">learning
chinese</a> 因為我很喜歡中文的文化. I also like playing guitar and <a href="https://mek.fyi/#music-art">recording music</a>. I like <a href="https://mek.fyi/#cooking">cooking</a> for other people and I am an avid <a href="https://mek.fyi/#rock-climbing">indoor rock climber (bouldering)</a>. I enjoy reading non-fiction literature, watching educational lectures, and I really enjoy <a href="https://mek.fyi/#essays">writing essays</a> and discussing philosophy with friends. I like hosting house dinners and going for long walks, hikes, or cycling. I also really enjoy my work and often work on <a href="https://mek.fyi/#projects">projects &amp; prototypes</a> in my free time..
</p>

<h2>Not-A-Date Activities</h2>
<p><strong>No's.</strong> I'm not really about dining as an
experience. And I'm not a big drinker. So I'm not enthralled with the
idea of fancy sit down restaurants or bars for "dates". It feels
performative like being on a reality show interview. I'm also not a
big fan of movie theaters because it perpetually distracts and
detracts from conversation. I don't like bars because I want me and my
date to behave like ourselves and not hide behind inhebriation. For
similar reasons as bars and movies, not a big fan of comedy for
not-a-dates.
</p>

<p><strong>Yes's.</strong> I'm almost always down for the following activities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gym rock climbing
@ <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Brooklyn+Boulders+Somerville/@42.3829791,-71.1080024,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e377365810bec3:0xfe4e83648f71541a!8m2!3d42.3817711!4d-71.1059276">Brooklyn
Boulders, Somerville</a> (specifically bouldering, not rope
climbing)</li>
<li>Walking around the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Museum+of+Fine+Arts,+Boston/@42.339381,-71.0962367,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x89e37a0de7e77a4b:0x2f033fd6c495d564!8m2!3d42.339381!4d-71.094048">MFA</a> or other art studios/galleries</li>

<li>Playing music together</li>
<li>Going for a long walk around a city, park, or hike a trail, sculpture garden, botanical garden</li>
<li>Bike ride on a trail (I need to buy a bike in Somerville if I stay here)</li>
<li>Fruit picking</li>
<li>Meeting at a cafe (FORGE, 1369 Cafe, 3 Little Figs) esp w/ comfy <a href="https://www.facebook.com/muddywatersvt/">inviting seating</a> or couches!</li>
<li>Could also be convinced to axe throw, bowl, go ice skating, and more! Wow!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Music</h2>
<p>I like signing with people and playing music
together. In <a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10103274020034470">2017</a>
I immediately answered: if I could clone myself and he could only do
one thing, we'd sign and harmonize with each other. Here's
some <a href="https://mek.fyi/music/playlist">music I really
like</a>.</p>

<h2>On Affection</h2>
<p>I enjoy cuddling, I'm very affectionate, I like holding
hands. But more than affection, what I care about is that
others I'm with feel comfortable, safe, and secure, and happy.</p>

<h2>On Sexuality</h2>
<p>As noted by someone in <a href="#public-private">On Being Public
&amp; Private</a> I don't write often about sexuality, perhaps because
like many men, I am conditioned by prevailing narratives to feel self
conscious, to question my adequancy, and otherwise it's generally an
area where I don't feel I have much to teach others. Neither would I
feel comfortable being someone who brags on the topic as I worry it
risks perpetuating insecurity for others.
</p>

<p>On a personal level, so much of my identity and sense of personal
value/worth comes from doing for others; so to me, expectation and
performative pressure to conflate one's personal worth with their
ability to satisfy others can at times feel more stressful than
enjoyable, when not discussed or experienced with people whom I share
trust, comfort, and understanding. Sex is great, would recommend. I've
just become thoughtful and selective about who I like to have sex
with because, to me a bad trip can feel like being between a
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/michael.karpeles/posts/10103368730982970">rock-and-the-hard-place</a>
of either feeling too selfish (which is a feeling I hate; I don't like
taking pleasure when it's at the expense of another), uncomfortable if
it's not someone I intimately respect or whom I am not attracted, or anxious about
how comfortable or good my partner is feeling.
</p>

<p>There's also a part of me which recognizes the selfish persuance of
satisfying my own needs as a possible vector for my exploitation,
distortion/manipulation, and distraction away from other things I care
about. While this narrative, which Benjamin Franklin aspires and others
profess, may not be one I pay much credence, I still appreciate, from
a "do as I say, not as I do" sentiment, (as its sentiment
caresses several virtues; temperance, tranquility, moderation,
justice, sincerity) the wisdom in:
